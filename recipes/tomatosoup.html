    <h3>Tomato Soup</h3>
    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Canned DicedTomatoes</li>
            <li>Olive oil and butter</li>
            <li>carrots</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>Vegetable Broth</li>
            <li>Full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>Dried thyme</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Fresh Basil Leaves</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, saut√© the veggies. Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, and add the olive oil. Add the onion, carrots, garlic, and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies soften, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next, add the remaining ingredients and simmer. Add the canned tomatoes, water, coconut milk or heavy cream, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then, blend part of the soup. This step makes it sooo creamy! Scoop 4 cups of the soup out of the pot and set aside. Transfer the remaining soup to a blender, and blend until smooth. If you like, you could use an immersion blender for this step, though I prefer the smoother texture I get when I use my upright blender. Return the pureed soup to the pot, along with the 4 cups of chunky soup. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Finally, season to taste and serve. Thats it!</li>
        </ol>
